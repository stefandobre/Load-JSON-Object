  "description" : "This small utility plugin adds a JSON Object to the page already at render time. For small sets of data, you don't have to bother with AJAX requests. As source for the JSON Object, you can choose 'SQL Query', 'SQL Query returning JSON Object', 'PL/SQL Procedure' or provide it as plain text.<p><b>Short info about \"Commercially Supported\"</b></p><p>This plug-in remains free and open source under MIT license!</p><p>If you have any problems with it, you can always create an issue on GitHub and I may find the time at some point in the future to resolve it for you. The guys at FOEX also offer commercial support for this plug-in. They have added this plug-in as a part of their \"APEX Plug-in Support Package\", for more information please visit: https://www.foex.at/plugin-support. I have opted to include my plug-in in their support package because you can get professional support for any issues you face in a timely manner as well as the \"peace of mind\" that it will be supported for many years to come!</p>",
